1. INSTALLATION	

This program comes with an PHP installation. 

IF PHP 5.4.0 or higher is already installed on this machine, then use the "php-when php already installed"
ini file. rename to "php.ini"

IF there is a lower version of PHP or no PHP installed at all the user can opt to follow the above steps
BUT no new tweets can be received then. else:

To use the included version of PHP just rename the file "php-when no php installed.ini" to "php.ini"
This will enable all functionality.

Also a required step for both cases is to install the security certificate. this is done by simply
placing the "cacert.pem" file in "C:\" (this location is chosen because it has to be an absolute path).

To use another or alternative tweets or sentiment file simply place the files in the "Userfiles" folder.
You can put as many files there as you want. Just keep in mind to use the correct filename in the program.

The output generated by this program wil be opened as well as saved to the Userfiles folder.

2. GUIDE

To start the program use the "Sentiment.exe" executable.
(the ServerController.exe is called with the correct parameters from inside sentiment.exe)

The program consists of a multitude of functions. 
The most important one is the requirement to select a PHP.exe. this is required to run the scripts that
are used to perform all operations. 
	To select the php.exe simply click the button and a filebrowser will be opened. Navigate to
	the folder in which the required php.exe is located (this should be either the included file, or
	an existing installation). 

Once a php.exe is selected the other buttons will be enabled. Except for the "retrieve tweets" button.
	that button will be enabled once the server is started. 

To start the server you have to make sure you have selected the correct php.exe and have renamed the
	correct php.ini file. (this is because this application requires specific settings, this ini file is
	included so no changes will be made to any existing php installations)
	Note: specifying a port is optional, the default port is 8000.

To retrieve tweets, simple enter the desired amount of tweets you want. Keep in mind, the maximum amount of tweets
	retrieved from the twitter API will always be 100. 
	Note: to use this functionality the serverwindow must remain open. if it is closed restart the
	server for this functionality to work. Also make sure that the cacert.pem file is in the correct
	location.

To perform a sentiment analysis you have to specify the file where the sentiment scores can be found,
	and the file with the tweets. This is filled with the default files which are located in the 
	Userfiles folder. Other files can be used as long as they are placed in that folder and 
	are .txt files. Keep in mind that you only have to specify the name and extension of the file.
	Once the analysis is done the results will be saved to the userfiles folder and they will also be
	opened so the user can view them.
	Note: the last line in the result file contains the number of processed tweets. This amount
	CAN be lower than the amount of tweets the analysis is done on. This is because tweets without text
	cannot be processed and thus will not fall through the code. This prevents them from getting
	a value (i have yet to figure out why this happens, probably because i filter on the status element)

To calculate the term frequency you only have to specify the tweetsfile. The requirements and steps are the same
	as with the sentiment analysis. The results will also be opened for the user and saved to the userfiles folder

To calculate the happiest state you have to specify both the sentiment score file and the tweets file.
	As with all field these are filled with the default values which the program will use. The steps and
	requirements are the same as with the sentiment analysis. The results are too.

To calculate the most common hashtags, this was a problem since in the assignment you had to only show
	the TEN most used hashtags, but a few lines down you had to show ALL hashtags. I cannot do both,
	so i chose to only show the TEN most occurring hashtags. The requirements, steps and results
	are the same as with the term frequency analysis.


-----------------
This program has been tested on devices with PHP installed AND tested on a device with NO PHP installed.
If PHP is installed the current installed version should be used. IF this version is below 5.4 then the 
Ebedded server does not work. No guarantees can be made regardless of the version (included or not) you use.
